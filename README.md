## Setup

This project was built based on Tom Wayson's example of [esri-webpack-babel](https://github.com/tomwayson/esri-webpack-babel/).

It uses [ArcGIS API for Javascript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) for all 3D mapping things and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management (using [redux-watch](https://github.com/jprichardson/redux-watch) to detect what changed in the state). [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for transpiling, [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for CSS compiling and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for all bundling/serving matters. [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js) by [Matt Boldt](https://mattboldt.com/) is used for the typing animations.
