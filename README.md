## Setup

This project was built based on Tom Wayson's example of [esri-webpack-babel](https://github.com/tomwayson/esri-webpack-babel/).

It uses ArcGIS API for Javascript and Redux for state management. Babel for transpiling, SASS for CSS compiling and Webpack for all bundling/serving matters.

This project is written by a beginner, therefore it's very beginner friendly.
